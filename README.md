# Life Expectancy and GDP Project

In this project we analyzed data from the World Health Organization and World Bank on GDP and life expectancy of 6 different countries.

The main goal of this project was to identify the relationship between GDP and life expectancy of these countries as well as some other key focuses listed in the project.

In the analysis we explore trends, patterns and potential correlations as well as deviations from the expected relationships between the GDP and life expectancy of these countries.

A summary of the findings and potential further research is located at the end of the project under Conclusion and Further Research, respectively.
